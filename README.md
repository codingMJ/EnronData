# EnronData

Enron_data_EDA_on_emails.ipynb can be considered deprecated. It has unfinished EDA steps due to some package incompatibilities.
I uploaded Enron_data_EDA_on_emails V2.ipynb instead.

Most of the EDA steps were made just as initial quick spotcheck steps with no specific purpose. Because the first step was to search for quick and obvious patterns.
